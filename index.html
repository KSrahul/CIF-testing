                        <p>
                            India and China are two of the oldest continuous civilizations that share a rich history of people-to-people and cultural exchange. Apart from trade and Buddhism, both countries exchanged knowledge in areas such as mathematics, astronomy, and medicine,
                            dating back to 200 BCE. However, relations between the two countries from the mid-20th century onwards have been strained, and exchange has been sparse.

                            Today, China is the world’s second largest economy, and India is the world’s 6th largest economy. Trade between the two countries hit a record high of US$84.4 billion in 2017, growing at double-digit growth rates despite bilateral tensions. In the 21st
                            century, China and India’s growth will be led by their digital economies and will continue to become more interdependent. China has pledged to expand its $3.8 trillion digital economy and create jobs in new sectors like big
                            data and artificial intelligence. India’s digital economy is expected to increase three times over a ten-year period to $1.15 trillion.

                            The partnership between China and India will arguably become one of the most important partnerships of the 21st century. By 2030, led by China and India, Asia will surpass the combined power of North America and Europe in terms of economic influence.
                            With their massive populations, economies, and environmental impacts, these two countries have an outsized effect on the trajectory of global affairs. It is therefore crucial that these two countries can foster a healthy working
                            relationship on bilateral, regional, and global issues. Increasing citizen-level mutual understanding is a vital part of this process.
